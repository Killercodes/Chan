== How to use it
Start Chanmongler.exe. If it doesn't work,
install Microsoft .NET Framework v2.0 or newer.


== About the source code
It was all written before I learned how to code.
It's probably the most horrible piece of jumbled
crap ever released under the GNU GPL. Tbh I just
wanted to get this project out of the way, so I
barely bothered cleaning out the worst parts.

If you're trying to learn how to code properly,
DON'T READ THESE SOURCE CODES. You'll thank me.
